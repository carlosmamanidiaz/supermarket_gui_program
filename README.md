# Supermarket GUI Program
Tool for use in a supermarket Cash Register, allows to add customers, bosses, clients with their properties such as name, email, photo. These are stored in binary files. 
The program receives the path to the faces folder, where we find photos of customers and cashiers, these photos go through the microsoft azure cognitive services, to recognize the mood, age and gender of the photos. In the gui query we can request the list of stored customers, users and bosses.
